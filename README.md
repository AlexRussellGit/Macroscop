Security Access System WPF Application
Overview
This repository contains a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application designed using .NET and following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. The application serves as an interface to interact with a security access system through APIs, providing a user-friendly way to manage access permissions and monitor security events.

Features
MVVM Architecture: The application follows the MVVM architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The code is organized into models, views, and view models, promoting a clean and modular design.

API Integration: The application leverages APIs to communicate with the security access system. This allows for seamless integration and real-time updates of access permissions and security events.

User Management: Administrators can add, edit, and remove users, assigning specific access levels and permissions. User information is stored securely and can be easily managed through the application.

Access Control: The application provides a user-friendly interface to define and manage access control rules. Administrators can set access schedules, restricted areas, and other parameters to enhance security.

Security Event Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of security events is integrated into the application. Users can view logs, alerts, and other relevant information to ensure a proactive approach to security management.
