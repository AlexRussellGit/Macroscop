Security Access System WPF Application
Overview
This repository contains a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application designed using .NET and following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. The application serves as an interface to interact with a security access system through APIs, providing a user-friendly way to manage access permissions and monitor security events.

Features
MVVM Architecture: The application follows the MVVM architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The code is organized into models, views, and view models, promoting a clean and modular design.

API Integration: The application leverages APIs to communicate with the security access system. This allows for seamless integration and real-time updates of access permissions and security events.

Access Control: The application provides a user-friendly interface for defining and managing access control rules. Administrators can set access schedules, restricted areas, and other parameters to enhance security.

Door Control: Administrators can send requests to open or close doors through the application. The system provides real-time feedback on the status of doors, allowing administrators to monitor and control access effectively.

Prerequisites
.NET Framework or .NET Core
Visual Studio (or any preferred .NET development environment)
